# CS321_prj2
This is the second project of CS321. It aims to convert an infix expression to an assembly instruction by converting the expression to a postfix expression. 

Compile and run the file Postfix.java using java Postfix.java [input directory] [output directory] will result in an out.txt file in [output directory] with full infix expression

Compile and run assembler.java, using java assembler.java [input directory] [output directory] will create multiple instruction files for each infix expression given. In the case that
no output directory is given, all the instructions will be printed to the terminal. 

During this project I worked all on my own since I couldn't find a teammate and it was already too late to do so. This makes it harder since the project is considerably long and it can benefit more if two people work on different roles during the project. Interpreting and implementing the three increments on my own is indeed challenging and time consuming. Professor Nadi also granted me an extension to finish the project since I have been experiencing personal loss this semester, and my performance has been deteriorated toward the second half of the semester. I am very thankful for his support, and will try my best for the next projects.
