# CS321_prj2
This is the second project of CS321. It aims to convert an infix expression to an assembly instruction by converting the expression to a postfix expression. 
Compile and run the file Postfix.java using java Postfix.java [input directory] [output directory] will result in an out.txt file in [output directory] with full infix expression
Compile and run assembler.java, using java assembler.java [input directory] [output directory] will create multiple instruction files for each infix expression given. In the case that
no output directory is given, all the instructions will be printed to the terminal.
